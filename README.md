This project uses a ResNet50 convolutional neural network to classify skin conditions from images. The workflow includes preprocessing, cleaning, and augmenting a large image dataset so the model can learn meaningful visual patterns. After training, the model predicts the most likely skin disease category for new input images.
The goal of this project is to explore deep learning–based image recognition techniques in a medical context. This code is for research and educational purposes only and is not intended for clinical use or diagnosis.

**Features:**

ResNet50 architecture with transfer learning

Automated data preprocessing and augmentation

Training pipeline for large image datasets

Image-based prediction interface for model outputs

**Requirements:**

Python 3.x

TensorFlow / Keras

NumPy, Pandas

Matplotlib, scikit-learn

**Usage:**

Place your dataset in the expected directory structure.

Run the preprocessing script to clean and augment the images.

Train the model using the training script.

Use the prediction to classify new skin images.

**Disclaimer:**

This project is not a medical device and should not be used for diagnostic purposes.
